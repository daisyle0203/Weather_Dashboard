## About

---

- This is a responsive weather dashboard app that allows users to see the weather outlook for multiple cities.
- Users can search for a city and are presented its current and future weather conditions (the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index).
- The five most recent clicked cities are added below the search bar. When users clicked on them, they are again presented with current and future conditions for those cities.
- Different background images are shown depending on different weather conditions.
- Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and [weatherbit.io API](https://www.weatherbit.io/).
